### Run Locally

* Since this app relies on firebase, you need to create a firebase project and replace the google-services.json.
** Also enable the Firestore Database.
* You also need to create a keystore file and insert the key.properties plus keystore file or remove the signing configs inside the build.gradle


### Stylus drawing

This app detects whether you are using a stylus or your finger using a `Listener`-widget.
